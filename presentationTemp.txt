Lets talk about parallelization in general, in computers.
How does it work? 
  - CPU Cores?
  - Processes?
  - Threads?

Main use cases with powershell: 
	Editing / computing from lots of files
	Copying lots of files
	doing things on many computers
	Doing stuff with lots of IO / timeouts (hitting a webservice, pinging many computers or endpoints, etc)

Python is single threaded only. Any appearance of multithreading is just that, appearance. Like threads on a single core machine.

ForEach -Parallel (lol workflows only, gg). No demo.
